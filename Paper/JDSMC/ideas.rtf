\f0\fs24 \cf0 Difference from Leung\'92s work:\
1. In Leung\'92s work, robots do not update state estimate at every step. It only updates when a checkpoint is found. The result is that, the pair of robots who exchange information at the checkpoint will have the same state estimate in store, and some measurements that will be used for future fusion. This is very different from my work! My work does not ensure the same estimate at each time between some pair of robots, but ensure consistency and utilize the most up-to-date measurement.\
2. In Leung\'92s work, the exchanged information include state estimate, measurement and odometry. My method does not exchange state estimate.\
3. My work can also prove the consistency even intermittent measurement is received. though not equivalent to centralized case, but will also be consistent.\
4. My work is different in that the way Leung used to handle separate groups of robots does not apply to my case, since all robots measure the target. So the pdf are correlated, even the measurements are obtained separately.\
\
My potential contribution:\
besides the points mentioned above, my work can potentially handle more cases:\
1. dynamic network with unidirectional communication\
2. changing number of robots (use the property of asymptotic consistency)}
