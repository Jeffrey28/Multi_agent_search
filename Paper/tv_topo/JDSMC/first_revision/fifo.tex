\section{Full-In-and-Full-Out (\proto) Protocol}\label{sec:\proto}		
	This study proposes a Full-In-and-Full-Out (\proto) protocol for measurement exchange in dynamically changing interaction topologies for the purpose of applying distributed Bayesian filters to target tracking.
%	In our previous work, we proposed a Latest-In-and-Full-Out (LIFO) protocol and can be used for time-invariant topologies.
%	{\proto} is suitable for time-varying topologies.
%	Let $y_k^i=\left\lbrace x^i_k,z^i_k\right\rbrace$ and $Y^i_{\K}=\left\lbrace y_{k}^i|k\in \K\right\rbrace$, where $\K$ is an index set of time steps.
	\textcolor{orange}{The use of {\proto} allows us to extend measurement dissemination-based distributed filtering to dynamically changing networks while avoiding the out-of-sequence measurement issue.}

	Let \small$Y^i_{\K}=\lb \left[x^i_k,z^i_k\right]|k\in \K\rb$\normalsize 
	% $Y^i_{\K^{i,j}_k}=\lb \left[x^{i,j}_t,z^{i,j}_t\right]|t\in \K^{i,j}_k\rb$
	be the set of state-measurement pairs of the $i\thi$ UGV, where $\K$ is an index set of time steps.
	Each UGV contains a communication buffer (CB) and a track list (TL). 
	The CB stores state-measurement pairs 
%	consisting of measurements and the corresponding states 
	of all UGVs:
	\small\begin{equation*}		
		\B^i_k=\left[ Y^1_{\K^{i1}_k},\dots,Y^N_{\K^{iN}_k}\right],
%		\mathbf{z}^{CB,i}_k=\left[ z^1_{k^i_1},\dots,z^N_{k^i_N}\right]
	\end{equation*}\normalsize
%	where $z^j_{k^i_j}$ represents the observation made by ${j\thi}$ UGV at time $k^i_j$. 
	where $\B^i_k$ is the CB of $i\thi$ UGV at time $k$ and $\K^{ij}_k (j\in V)$ is the time index set.
	$Y^j_{\K^{ij}_k}$ represents the set of $j\thi$ UGV's state-measurement pairs of time steps in $\K^{ij}_k$ that are stored in $i\thi$ UGV's CB at time $k$.	
%	Note that under {\proto} and certain conditions (\Cref{prop1}) of interaction topologies, $\mathcal{Q}_i=\left\lbrace 1,\dots,N\right\rbrace \setminus \left\lbrace i\right\rbrace$, i.e. each robot can know the measurements from all other robots. 
%	This will be proved in \Cref{cor1}.
%%	$z^j_{k^i_j}$ is stored in the CB of ${i\thi}$ UGV, where $k^i_j$ is the latest observation time of ${j\thi}$ UGV that is available to ${i\thi}$ UGV by time $k$. Due to the communication delay, $k^i_j<k, \forall j\neq i$ and $k^i_i=k$ always holds.
%	Let $G_k\in\bar{G} $ represent the interaction topology at time $k$. 
	The TL stores the information of each UGV's reception of other UGVs' measurements and is used for trimming old state-measurement pairs in the CB to reduce the communication burden.
	The details of TL will be introduced in \Cref{subsec:tracklist}.
	Each UGV sends its CB and TL to its {\onbhd} at every time step.
	
	The \textbf{{\proto} protocol} is stated in \Cref{alg:lifo}.
%	Note that each section in the algorithm contains the CB and TL parts.
%	Note that in the Updating Step, the algorithm uses \Cref{alg:tracklist}, which we will introduce in \Cref{sec:tracklist}. 
%	For the purpose of clarity, we ignore the TL parts at this stage and will describe them in \Cref{subsec:tracklist}.
%	this operation and do not trim CB at this stage.
%	For the clarity of explanation of DBF in \cref{sec:\proto-dbf}, we define a \textit{new observation set} $\mathbf{z}^{new,i}_k$ for $i\thi$ UGV to denote the set of observations that the $i\thi$ UGV receives and stores in its CB at $k$.

	\cref{fig:\proto} illustrates the {\proto} cycles of a network of 3 UGVs with switching topologies.
%	There are two types of topologies: under the first one only UGV $1$ and UGV $2$ can directly communicate and under second one only UGV $2$ and UGV $3$ can directly communicate.
	The following facts can be observed from \cref{fig:\proto}: 
	(1) the topologies are jointly strongly connected in the time interval $\left[0,6\right)$;
	(2) each UGV can receive the state-measurement pairs of other UGVs within finite steps.
	Extending these facts to a network of $N$ UGVs, we have the following properties of \proto:
	%\medskip
	
	\begin{thm}\label{prop1}
		Consider a network of $N$ UGVs with dynamically changing interaction topologies \small$\mathbb{G}=\lb G_{1},G_{2},G_{3}\dots,\rb$\normalsize.
%		\todohere{may rephrase the following sentence}
		If $\mathbb{G}$ is \fc, i.e.,
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item there exists an infinite sequence of time intervals $\left[k_m,k_{m+1} \right),\,m=1,2,\dots$, starting at $k_1=0$ and are contiguous, nonempty and uniformly bounded;
			\item the union of graphs across each such interval is jointly strongly connected,
		\end{enumerate}
		then each pair of UGVs can exchange measurements under \proto. 
		In addition, it takes no more than $NT_u$ steps for a UGV to communicate to another one, 
%		the communication distance (in terms of time) between each pair of UGVs is no greater than \small$(N-1)T_u$\normalsize, 
		where \small$T_u=\sup\limits_{m=1,2,\dots}\left( k_{m+1}-k_m\right) T$ \normalsize is the upper bound of interval lengths.
	\end{thm}
	
	\begin{proof}				
		Without loss of generality, we consider the transmission of $\B^i_{t_1}$ from the $i\thi$ UGV to an arbitrary $j\thi$ UGV ($j\in V\setminus \lb i\rb$), where $t_1\in\left[k_1,k_2 \right)$.
		Since each UGV will receive \inbhd' CBs and send the merged CB to its {\onbhd} at the next time step, the $i\thi$ UGV can transmit $\B^i_{t_1}$ to $j\thi$ UGV if and only if a path $\left[l_1,\dots,l_n\right]$ exists, with $l_1=i$, $l_n=j$, $l_2,\dots,l_{n-1}\in V\setminus\lb i,j\rb$, and the edges $(l_s,l_{s+1})$ appears no later than $(l_{s+1},l_{s+2})$, $s=1,\dots,n-2$.
		
		As the union of graphs across the time interval $\left[k_2,k_3 \right)$ is jointly connected, $i\thi$ UGV can directly send $\B^i_{t_1}$ to at least one another UGV at a time instance, i.e., $\exists l_2\in V\setminus \lb i\rb,\, \exists t_2\in \left[k_2,k_3 \right)$ s.t. $l_2\in\N^\text{out}_{i}(G_{t_2})$.
		If $l_2=j$, then $\B^i_{t_1}$ has been sent to $j$.
		If $l_2\neq j$, $\B^i_{t_1}$ has been merged into $\B^{l_2}_{t_2+1}$ and will be sent out in the next time step. 
		
		Using the similar reasoning for time intervals $\left[k_m,k_{m+1} \right),\;,m=3,4,\dots$, it can be shown that all UGVs can receive the state-measurement pairs in $\B^i_{t_1}$ no later by $k_{N+1}$.
		Therefore, the transmission time from an arbitrary UGV to any other UGVs is no greater than \small$NT_u$\normalsize.
		
%		\hfill\qedsymbol
	\end{proof}

	
%	Similar to the definition in \cite{jadbabaie2003coordination}, we define an interaction topology that satisfies the two conditions in \Cref{prop1} as a \textit{{\fc}} network.

%	\medskip
	\begin{cor}\label{cor1}
		For a {\fc} network, each UGV receives the CBs of all other UGVs under {\proto} within finite time. 
%		This implies $\mathcal{Q}_i = \left\lbrace1,\dots,N \right\rbrace \setminus \left\lbrace i\right\rbrace $.	
%		Additionally, the state-measurement pairs of all UGVs are updated every finite period of time.
	\end{cor}
	\begin{proof}
		%In a network of $N$ UGVs, the maximal length of shortest paths is no greater than $N-1$. 
		According to \Cref{prop1},
%		 the transmission delay between an arbitrary pair of UGVs is no greater than \small$(N-1)T_u$\normalsize.
		each UGV is guaranteed to receive $\B^j_t\; (\forall t\ge 0,\, j\in V)$ when \small$k\geq t+NT_u$\normalsize.
		
%		\hfill\qedsymbol
%		In addition, the state-measurement pairs in each gets updated every finite period of time that is no greater than \small$(N-1)T_u$\normalsize.
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{rem}
		\textcolor{orange}{
		\Cref{prop1} and \Cref{cor1} are the consequence of FIFO and the use of the communication buffer (CB). 
		In fact, if we use the traditional methods that each UGV only sends the current sensor measurement to neighboring UGVs without the use of CB, it can happen that two UGVs may never exchange their sensor measurements, even there exists a path connecting them.
		The condition of \fc ness is crucial for guaranteeing the consistency of the distributed Bayesian filter, as shown in \Cref{sec:consist_proof}.
	}
	\end{rem}
	
%	\begin{rem} 
%		The frequency that each UGV receives other UGVs' CBs depends on the connectivity of the network.
%		\Cref{cor1} gives an upper bound on the transmission time for all {\fc} networks under {\proto}.
%	\end{rem}
	
%	\medskip
	
	%\begin{rem}
	%	The \cref{prop1} provides an upper bound of the transmission delay between arbitrary pair of UGVs.
	%	One example of such delay can be found in line topology as shown in \cref{fig:com_topo}.
	%	\todohere{needs to write more details.}

	%\end{rem}
	%\medskip
	%\begin{cor}\label{cor2}
	%For the same network condition in \Cref{prop1}, all elements in $\mathbf{z}^{CB,i}_k$ are filled, the updating of each element is non-intermittent. 	
	%\end{cor}
	%\begin{proof}
	%For a network with fixed topology, shortest path(s) between any pair of nodes are fixed. 
	%Therefore, based on \Cref{prop1}, $\tau_{i,j}$ is constant and the updating of each element in $\mathbf{z}^{CB,i}_k$ is non-intermittent.
