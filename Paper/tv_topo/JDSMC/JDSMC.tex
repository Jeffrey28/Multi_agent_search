	\begin{abstract}
		This paper presents a novel distributed Bayesian filtering algorithm using measurement dissemination for multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) with dynamically changing interaction topologies.
		Different from statistics dissemination-based approaches that transmit posterior distributions or likelihood functions, this algorithm relies on the measurement dissemination scheme, which significantly reduces the transmission burden between each pair of UGVs. 
%		, called Full-In-and-Full-Out (\proto) protocol. 		
%		\todohere{explain how to disseminate}
%		that transmit posterior distributions or likelihood functions, each UGV under {\proto} only sends a communication buffer and a track list to neighboring agents,	
%		The information exchange among UGVs relies on a measurement dissemination scheme, called Full-In-and-Full-Out (\proto) protocol. 		
		Each UGV only sends a communication buffer and a track list to neighboring agents.
		A communication buffer contains its own measurements and the received ones from other UGVs.
		And a track list is used to trim all measurements in the buffer to reduce communication overhead.
		%		latest available measurements to neighboring nodes, 
%		 to scale linearly with the size of the network.
		Under the condition that the interaction topologies are \fc,
%		 union of undirected switching topologies is connected frequently enough,
		each UGV's measurements can be disseminated over the network within finite time.
%		The \proto-based DBF algorithm is then developed to estimate individual probability density function (PDF) with the application for target tracking.
%		in a static environment. 
		The proposed DBF algorithm is proved to achieve consistent state estimation.
%		, of this algorithm is proved that each individual estimate of target position converges in probability to the true target position.
		The effectiveness of this algorithm is validated by comparing with consensus-based distributed filters and the centralized filter in multi-target tracking simulations.
%		Simulation results on multiple target tracking demonstrate that the proposed DBF achieves comparable tracking performance as a centralized filter and has more superior uncertainty reduction performance than the commonly used consensus-based filter.
